    <h1>TurboChat Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: 7/20/24 7:49AM EDT</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to TurboChat! We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe online experience. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide through our service. By using TurboChat, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We collect several types of information to provide and improve our service to you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Information</strong>: When you create an account, we collect your username and password.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Log Data</strong>: We collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our service, including your IP address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and other statistics.</li>
      <li><strong>Messages</strong>: We collect and store messages sent through TurboChat to deliver them to your recipients. Additionally, admin users have access to view all messages sent through the service to monitor and ensure compliance with our terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Typing Indicators</strong>: We collect data on when you are typing to provide real-time feedback to the recipients.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To provide and maintain our service</strong>: We use your information to create and manage your account, authenticate users, and deliver messages.</li>
      <li><strong>To improve our service</strong>: We analyze usage data to improve the functionality and performance of TurboChat.</li>
      <li><strong>To communicate with you</strong>: We may send you service-related notifications and respond to your inquiries and support requests.</li>
      <li><strong>To ensure security</strong>: We use your information to monitor and enhance the security of TurboChat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties, except in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With your consent</strong>: We may share or disclose your information with your consent.</li>
      <li><strong>For legal reasons</strong>: We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</li>
      <li><strong>To protect our rights</strong>: We may disclose your information to enforce our terms of service, protect the security or integrity of our service, and protect the rights, property, or safety of TurboChat, our users, or others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use appropriate security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>HTTP vs. HTTPS</h2>
    <p>TurboChat currently operates over HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). HTTP does not encrypt the data transmitted between your browser and our servers, which means that your information, including messages and login details, could potentially be intercepted by third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>Implications of Using HTTP:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: Data transmitted over HTTP is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to interception by malicious actors.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Risks</strong>: Without encryption, sensitive information such as passwords and messages can be accessed by unauthorized parties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Avoid Sharing Sensitive Information</strong>: Refrain from sharing highly sensitive information over TurboChat.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Secure Networks</strong>: Use TurboChat on trusted and secure networks to reduce the risk of data interception.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are working towards implementing HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) in the future to ensure encrypted and secure communication between your browser and our servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide our service and comply with legal obligations. Messages are stored until you or your recipient delete them.</p>

    <h2>Your Privacy Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access and Update Information</strong>: You can access and update your account information through your profile settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete Account</strong>: You can delete your account by contacting our support team. Please note that deleting your account will remove your profile and messages from our service.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-Out of Communications</strong>: You can opt-out of receiving service-related notifications by adjusting your account settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of TurboChat after any modifications to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
